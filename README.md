# FTA AppDev Sessions

Delivery:

- Customer should already be working with an FTA engineer who understands their issues, goals and objectives
- One hour sessions (I believe most people can put one hour on their calendars)
- Sessions should have well defined learning objectives
- Atteneedes should come out of the sessions having met the learning objectives
- Those technologies that have more demand should have more frequent sessions (i.e. AKS)
- Session content should include tips, guidance, and best practices during the session

Some cons:

- Customers are not comfortable talking about their specific scenarions
  - It is important for the customers to be working with a lead engineers who will be responsible for understanding their specific scenarios
- Customer sends everyone else but the team that will work with FastTrack
  - Make sure the customer understand the value proposition of working attending the session

Sessions:

- [AKS](AKS.md)
- [App Services](APP-SERVICES.md)
- [API Management](APIM.md)
- [Azure Functions](AZURE-FUNCTIONS.md)
