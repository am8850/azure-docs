# FTA AppDev Sessions

Delivery:

- One hour sessions (I believe most people can put one hour on their calendars)
- Sessions should have well defined learning objectives
- Atteneedes should come out of the sessions having met the learning objectives
- Those technologies that have more demand should have more frequent sessions

Sessions:

- [AKS](AKS.md)
- [App Services](APP-SERVICES.md)
- [API Management](APIM.md)
